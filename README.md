Hello Odin!
This project is to learn the fundamentals of coding, to develop my understanding of creating code to adapt it into my WebDesign studies. 
I want to higher my chances of getting a good job, and quite francly, I do enjoy creating websites more than doing user-research, etc. 
All in all, coding & working on 'how' a website looks & feels are more interesting.
